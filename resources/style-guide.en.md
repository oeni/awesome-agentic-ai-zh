## 1. Project entry schema

Every project entry uses this structure:

```markdown
### [Repo Name](https://github.com/owner/repo) ⭐⭐⭐⭐

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Language | Python |
| Stars | ★ 12k+ |
| License | MIT |
| Recommendation | ⭐⭐⭐⭐ |

**What it teaches**: 1-2 sentences on what this project teaches at this stage.

**Best for**: 1 sentence on who should study this and why.

**Notes**: 1-3 sentences of personal evaluation. What's strong, what's weak, what to skip. (Optional.)

**Run it**:
\`\`\`bash
# minimal install / first-run command
\`\`\`
```

### Required fields
- `Stars` (`★ Xk+` format, no thousands separator)
- `License` (SPDX ID or annotated exception, see §5)
- `Recommendation` (⭐ × N, see §2)
- `What it teaches`, `Best for`

### Optional fields
- `Language` — primary programming language (Python / TypeScript / Chinese)
- `Format` — when not a repo: article / course / video
- `Last update` / `Status` — flag if stale or maintenance slowed
- `Notes`, `Run it`

### Heading conventions
- Stages 1-4 / 6 use `### [Repo](url)`
- Stage 5 / 7 / branches use `#### [Repo](url)` (when there's a parent H3 category)
- Suffix with stars allowed: `### [Repo](url) ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐` or sub-label: `### [Repo](url) ⭐ Official`

---

## 2. Recommendation star definitions

| Stars | Meaning | When to use |
|---|---|---|
| ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ | Must-read / must-run | Skipping this will get you stuck in this stage |
| ⭐⭐⭐⭐ | Highly recommended | Strong material to deepen the topic |
| ⭐⭐⭐ | Solid example | Worth running for cross-reference |
| ⭐⭐ | Useful reference | Browse if interested |
| ⭐ | Niche / advanced / for completeness | Most readers can skip |

**Rules:**
- A repo cited in different stages / branches **should have the same rating** (unless audience-specific reason, then note it explicitly)
- Don't inflate stars to "look encouraging." Honesty > politeness
- Commercial products (Cursor, LangSmith, etc.) follow the same scale

---

## 3. Banned words & alternatives

This document is **Traditional Chinese (zh-TW, Taiwan)**. The Chinese-side guide enumerates the zh-CN slips to avoid. For the English companion files, the rules are simpler:

### Avoid overclaim phrases

| Avoid | Use instead |
|---|---|
| "the best in the world" / "industry's strongest" | "comprehensive" / "well-known" / "widely-used" |
| "production-grade" (when describing teaching material) | "teaching-oriented" / "material to learn production patterns from" |
| "the only choice" / "definitive" | "a good option" / "an entry-level pick" |
| "the most urgent" / "the most important" | (just drop the modifier) |
| "authoritative reference" (unless truly the official spec) | "important reference implementation" / "official template" |
| "no problem" (re: legal/license) | "check the terms before use" / "verify the terms yourself" |

---

## 4. English nouns to keep

Technical writing has terms that **read more naturally in English** than translated:

- `LLM`, `API`, `SDK`, `MCP`
- `agent`, `tool use`, `function calling`, `prompt`, `prompt caching`
- `framework`, `library`, `repo`, `commit`, `PR`, `branch`
- `RAG`, `embedding`, `vector DB`, `retrieval`, `chunk`, `token`
- `streaming`, `async`, `batch`, `webhook`
- `marketplace`, `plugin`, `skill`, `hook`
- `production` (when meaning "production environment") — but the catalog deliberately avoids it in many places (see Chinese §3)
- `Hello-X`, `hello-world` — keep

**Test**: Would a technical reader pause at the translated form? If yes, keep English.

---

## 5. License notation conventions

### Direct SPDX
- `MIT`
- `Apache-2.0`
- `BSD-3-Clause`
- `GPL-3.0`
- `LGPL-3.0`

### Annotated exceptions

| Situation | Notation |
|---|---|
| No SPDX upstream | `NOASSERTION (no SPDX upstream; check LICENSE before use)` |
| AGPL (copyleft) | `AGPL-3.0` + Notes: `AGPL-3.0 license (copyleft) — derivative products that ship modifications must follow the terms.` |
| Custom non-commercial | `NOASSERTION (custom non-commercial)` + Notes: `License is a custom non-commercial term — read the original terms before use.` |
| Multiple per-plugin | `NOASSERTION (each plugin has its own license; check per plugin)` |
| Creative Commons | `CC-BY-4.0`, `CC-BY-NC-SA-4.0`, etc. |

**Rule**: **Never** read a license as legal advice. Don't say "fine for personal use." Say "read the original terms before use."

---

## 6. Stage page template

Every stage (except Stage 0) should have:

```markdown
# Stage N — Topic

> **English** | [繁體中文](./0N-slug.md)

⏱ **Time estimate**: N-M weeks (~X-Y hours)

[1-2 sentence description of the stage's core question]

## 📌 Learning Goals
- bullet 1
- bullet 2

## 🚪 Entry Conditions (Stage 1+ only)
You should have:
- ...

## 📚 Required Reading
1. [Link](url) — description
2. ...

## 🛠 Hello-X Projects (must run, not just read)

### Hello-N: Title
Description.

[3-5 Hello-X items]

## 🎯 Curated Projects

### [Project Name](url) ⭐⭐⭐⭐
[entry schema per §1]

[N entries]

## ✅ Self-Check Before Stage N+1
Can you:
- [ ] ...
- [ ] ...

If yes → proceed to Stage N+1.
If no → ...

## 💡 What's Next (optional, mostly used in the last stage)
```

**Stage 0 exception**: can omit `Curated Projects` and `Entry Conditions` — it's a prerequisite gateway.

---

## 7. Branch page template

```markdown
# For [audience] — Specialized Branch

> **English** | [繁體中文](./for-X.md)

> [← Back to main path README](../README.en.md) · Branching from end of Stage 7

## Use Cases
- bullet 1
- bullet 2

## Curated Projects

### Sub-category 1
#### [Project](url) ⭐⭐⭐⭐
[entry]

### Sub-category 2
...

## Required Reading
1. ...

## Workflows To Master
- bullet 1
- bullet 2
```

Branch entries can be more concise than stage entries (full schema table optional), but link + stars + 1-2 sentence description is the minimum.

---

## 8. Writing style

### Sentence length
- **Single sentence ≤ 25-30 words** for English
- Break long sentences into two
- Don't force English rhythm into translated Chinese (or vice versa)

### Voice
- Prefer active: "Claude calls the tool" ✓
- Avoid passive: "The tool is called by Claude" ✗

### "You" vs "we"
- **"You" first** — this is learner-facing material
- "I" for author opinion: "I recommend ..."
- Avoid "we" (unless real co-authors exist)

### Connectives
- Prefer simple: "but, so, because"
- Avoid: "however, therefore, hence"

---

## 9. Links and citations

### Internal links
- Between stages: relative path `[Stage 4](04-agent-frameworks.en.md)`
- Branch ↔ README: `[← Back to main path](../README.en.md)`
- Cross-stage repo references: full name + link, not just "as cited earlier"

### External links
- GitHub repo: `https://github.com/owner/repo` (no trailing slash)
- Article / blog: full URL, bold title
- Commercial product (Cursor, Make.com, etc.): official URL, not affiliate

### Link text conventions
- Repo entry heading: `[owner/repo](url)` or `[Project Name](url)`
- In-prose citation: `[Repo Name](url)` or `\`owner/repo\`` (inline code for short references)
- **Avoid**: "click here," "press this"
