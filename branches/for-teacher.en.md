# For Teachers — Specialized Branch

> [← Back to main path README](../README.en.md) · Branching from end of Stage 7. Apply agentic AI to teaching workflows.

## Use Cases

- Lesson plan generation
- Quiz / rubric creation
- Slide deck preparation
- Student feedback synthesis
- Curriculum mapping

## Curated Projects

### Teaching Workflow Skills

(Most are not yet skill-marketplace packaged. This branch has the most room for community contribution — see CONTRIBUTING.md.)

### Useful Building Blocks

#### [obra/superpowers](https://github.com/obra/superpowers) ⭐⭐⭐⭐
General writing / brainstorming skills. Adaptable for lesson prep.

#### [Claude Code](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code) (with custom CLAUDE.md) ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐
Best entry point for teachers. Use Claude.ai (web) for low-barrier start; upgrade to Claude Code for repeated workflows.

### Teaching Course Materials (for teachers preparing classes)

#### [huggingface/agents-course](https://github.com/huggingface/agents-course) ⭐⭐⭐⭐

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Stars | ★ 28k+ |
| License | Apache-2.0 |

**What it teaches**: Hugging Face's official agents curriculum — notebooks, exercises, certifications. A ready-made **AI agent teaching artifact**.

**Best for**: Teachers running an "AI agents intro" workshop or class who want existing materials to teach from or adapt.

**Notes**: This teaches *how to build agents* — it's not an "AI tutor for students" tool.

#### [datawhalechina/llm-universe](https://github.com/datawhalechina/llm-universe) ⭐⭐⭐⭐ (Chinese)

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Language | Chinese (zh-CN) |
| Stars | ★ 13k+ |
| License | NOASSERTION |

**What it teaches**: Datawhale's Chinese-language LLM application development course — RAG, agents, chapter exercises. A ready-made template for Chinese-speaking teachers preparing class material.

**Best for**: Chinese-language teachers wanting a ready LLM curriculum to adapt to their students' level.

**Notes**: Same caveat as `huggingface/agents-course` — it's "teach students to build LLM apps," not "AI assistant for the teacher."

### Prompt Libraries

#### [f/awesome-chatgpt-prompts](https://github.com/f/awesome-chatgpt-prompts) ⭐⭐⭐⭐

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Stars | ★ 161k+ |
| License | NOASSERTION (CC0 / public-domain-style, but no SPDX) |

**What it teaches**: Community-maintained prompt megacatalog — "act as X" templates covering hundreds of roles (teacher, interviewer, stand-up comedian, debater, ...). Teachers can use it as "prompt writing examples" to show students, or borrow specific prompts for in-class demos.

**Best for**: Teachers introducing "prompt engineering" who want concrete examples of different writing styles to compare.

**Notes**: Quality varies — treat as a sourcebook to pick from, not "use everything as-is."

---

### Reading Material

#### [The Effortless Academic — Beginner Guides](https://effortlessacademic.com/claude-code-and-cowork-for-academics-beginner-guide-part-1/)
Multi-part guide for academics adopting Claude Code, applicable to teachers.

## Workflows To Build

These are templates — adapt to your subject:

- **Lesson plan generator**: Prompt with curriculum + topic → outline → slides → assessment
- **Rubric creation**: Sample student work + learning objective → rubric draft
- **Personalized feedback**: Student submission + rubric → individualized written feedback (with human review)

## Tier Recommendations for Teachers

Most teachers should stay at **Tier 0 (browser chat)** or **Tier 1 (Claude Desktop)**:

- **Tier 0**: Claude.ai web chat — copy/paste your prompts, no install
- **Tier 1**: Claude Desktop — file uploads, save conversation history
- Don't jump to CLI / SDK unless you genuinely need automation

## Community Note

This branch is the smallest curated section currently. Contributions especially welcome:

- Lesson plan generation skills
- Subject-specific prompt libraries
- Teacher-specific MCP servers (gradebook integrations, LMS connections)
