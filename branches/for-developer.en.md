# For Developers — Specialized Branch

> [← Back to main path README](../README.en.md) · Branching from end of Stage 7. Apply agentic AI to coding workflows.

## Use Cases

- AI pair programming (Cursor, Aider, Claude Code, Cline, Continue)
- Code review automation
- Test generation
- Multi-agent coding tasks (planning + execution)
- IDE integration and CI governance

## Workflows To Master

- **AI pair programming**: pick one of Claude Code / Cursor / Cline for daily work
- **Git-native AI editing**: run Aider for a week, get used to the "AI edits → commit → review" rhythm
- **AI checks in CI**: use Continue to wire AI checks into your PR pipeline
- **Test generation**: write a skill / prompt that generates pytest tests from a function signature
- **Code review automation**: GitHub Action calling Claude API on every PR
